Hi!

This is my first hobby project Cheviren and its a translation tool for the people who try to translate things faster.

You can install the Cheviren.zip file to use this program. 

Usage is very simple:

---Download the Cheviren.zip file,

---Extract it,

---Start the program by double clicking the .exe file,

---Choose your Main Language ("Ana Dil" in Turkish) from Tray Menu,

---Copy the text you wanted to translate and you will see the translation of the choosen text at next to your mouse cursor.

---I tried but in case it doesn't start on its own when you open the PC you can read this:

I tried to make it as good as i can but it might have some problems.
